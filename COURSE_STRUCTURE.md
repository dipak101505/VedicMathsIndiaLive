## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. **Component Composition**
- Use composition over inheritance
- Pass data down through props
- Use custom hooks for shared logic

### 2. **State Management**
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use custom hooks for complex state logic
- Avoid prop drilling with context when needed

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Use useCallback and useMemo appropriately

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use try-catch blocks in async operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages

### 5. **Testing Strategy**
- Test custom hooks in isolation
- Test components with mocked hooks
- Use integration tests for complex workflows

## Benefits of This Structure

✅ **Clear separation of concerns** - Each file has a single responsibility  
✅ **Easy to maintain** - Changes are localized to specific files  
✅ **Reusable components** - Common UI elements can be shared  
✅ **Scalable architecture** - Easy to add new features and roles  
✅ **Testable code** - Components and hooks can be tested independently  
✅ **Developer experience** - Clear file organization makes development faster  

## Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Create the new folder structure
2. **Phase 2**: Move existing components to appropriate locations
3. **Phase 3**: Refactor components to use the new structure
4. **Phase 4**: Update imports and routing
5. **Phase 5**: Remove old files and clean up

This structure provides a solid foundation for a scalable, maintainable course management system while keeping the benefits of reusability without the drawbacks of over-coupling.
